You can power down an entire cluster after you have contacted NetApp Support and completed preliminary steps.

Prepare the cluster for shutdown by doing the following:

* Stop all I/O.
* Disconnect all iSCSI sessions.

. Navigate to the management virtual IP (MVIP) address on the cluster to open the Element UI.
. Note the nodes listed in the Nodes list.
. Run the Shutdown API method with the halt option specified on each Node ID in the cluster.
